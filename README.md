# My Daily Python
This repository consists of solutions of common programming challenges/questions in python.

I will be addressing following python programming problems here :
1. Generating the Fibonacci Series
2. Identifying the Armstrong No.
3. Creating Factorial of a no.
4. Generating Reverse of a digit
5. Identifying the second lowest and second highest no. in a list
6. Print the pattern
7. Sum of prime no.


These problems are important for getting hands on python programming and also from interview perspective
